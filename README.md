# MecBooksCart
Do you have books stacked up on your shelves catching dust or are you in your first year and shy to ask for books from your seniors? Worry not as we are introducing our college's first book exchange platform called MEC Books Cart where those who want to sell books can put up their books for sale and those who want to buy can select from the wide variety of books available for sale.

<h1>What We Do?</h1>                
 <p>One of the most significant difficulties faced by students at the beginning of a semester is getting the required reference material. We aim to solve this by an online textbook buy/sell platform.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ll connect you with the students on your very own college campus for direct buying and selling!</p>
